	// This file is included by every place that edited specification information for the file system connector
	// is posted upon submit.  When it is called, the Map parameters object is placed in the thread context
	// under the name "Parameters".  This map should be edited by this code.

	// The coder cannot presume that this jsp is executed within a body section.  Errors should thus be
	// forwarded to "error.jsp" using <jsp:forward>.
	// Arguments from the original request object for the post page will remain available for access.
